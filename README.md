# Wave Generator

**Wave Generator** is a Go-based application that processes images to extract wave patterns (originally designed for skylines, but applicable to any wave-like pattern in images). It performs mathematical analysis to represent these patterns as piecewise cubic polynomials and generates both SVG visualizations and mathematical equations.

## Overview

The **Wave Generator** application performs these key steps:

1. **Image Processing**: 
   - Converts input image to grayscale using luminance formula
   - Normalizes pixel values to [0,1] range
   
2. **Wave Pattern Extraction**: 
   - Detects patterns using vertical gradient analysis
   - Implements noise reduction and peak detection
   
3. **Polynomial Fitting**: 
   - Segments the pattern into optimal pieces
   - Fits cubic polynomials using least squares optimization
   
4. **SVG Generation**: 
   - Creates scalable vector graphics representation
   - Provides smooth curve visualization
   
5. **JSON Response**: 
   - Returns mathematical equations and SVG data
   - Includes segment metadata and error metrics

## Mathematical Foundations

### Wave Pattern Extraction

The pattern is extracted using an enhanced gradient detection algorithm. For each column x, we compute the normalized gradient G(x,y):

$$
G(x,y) = \frac{|I(x,y+1) - I(x,y)|}{\max_{y} |I(x,y+1) - I(x,y)|}
$$

Where:
- \( I(x,y) \in [0,1] \) is the normalized intensity at position (x,y)
- \( G(x,y) \in [0,1] \) is the normalized gradient magnitude

Peak detection uses a local maximum finder with configurable window size w:

$$
P(x) = \arg\max_{y \in [y-w,y+w]} G(x,y)
$$

### Cubic Polynomial Fitting

The pattern is segmented into n optimal pieces, where each segment is modeled by a cubic polynomial:

$$
f_i(x) = a_{3i}x^3 + a_{2i}x^2 + a_{1i}x + a_{0i}, \quad x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}]
$$

#### Least Squares Optimization

The coefficients vector \(\mathbf{a}_i = [a_{3i}, a_{2i}, a_{1i}, a_{0i}]^T\) is obtained by solving:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{a}_i} \|\mathbf{X}_i\mathbf{a}_i - \mathbf{y}_i\|_2^2
$$

Where the design matrix \(\mathbf{X}_i\) for segment i is:

$$
\mathbf{X}_i = 
\begin{bmatrix}
x_i^3 & x_i^2 & x_i & 1 \\
(x_i+1)^3 & (x_i+1)^2 & (x_i+1) & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
x_{i+1}^3 & x_{i+1}^2 & x_{i+1} & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The solution is computed using numerically stable QR decomposition:

$$
\mathbf{X}_i = \mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{R}_i \implies \mathbf{a}_i = \mathbf{R}_i^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_i^T\mathbf{y}_i
$$

#### Continuity Constraints

To ensure smooth transitions between segments, we enforce C¹ continuity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f_i(x_{i+1}) &= f_{i+1}(x_{i+1}) \\
f'_i(x_{i+1}) &= f'_{i+1}(x_{i+1})
\end{aligned}
$$

### SVG Generation

The SVG path is generated by sampling each polynomial at a resolution Δx:

$$
(x_k, y_k) = (x_i + k\Delta x, f_i(x_i + k\Delta x))
$$

The resulting polyline is rendered as:

```xml
<svg viewBox="0 0 W H" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <polyline 
    fill="none" 
    stroke="lime" 
    stroke-width="2" 
    points="x₁,y₁ x₂,y₂ ... xₙ,yₙ"
  />
</svg>
```
